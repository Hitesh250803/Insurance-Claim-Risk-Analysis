🧩 Problem Statement
Insurance companies manage thousands of policies and claims across different customer demographics, vehicle types, and regions. Without consolidated analytics, it is difficult to:
•	Track policies and claims in one place.
•	Identify high-risk customers and vehicles.
•	Monitor claim severity vs frequency.
•	Optimize pricing and detect fraud.
This project delivers an interactive Power BI dashboard that centralizes policy and claim data, enabling data-driven risk profiling and better decision-making for insurers.

🎯 Project Objectives
• Monitor total policies, claim amounts, and claim frequency to track portfolio performance.
• Analyze demographics (age, gender, marital status, education, income) to understand customer risk profiles.
• Evaluate vehicle-related risks (car make, year, and usage type) to detect high-claim segments.
• Compare coverage zones and household factors (e.g., kids driving) to assess exposure levels.
• Provide interactive dashboards with drill-downs and slicers for deeper segmentation analysis.

📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
•	Total Policies → e.g., 1,240 active policies
•	Total Claim Amount → e.g., $2.3M filed in claims
•	Average Claim Amount → e.g., $1,860 per policyholder
•	Claim Frequency → e.g., 0.32 claims per policy
•	Gender-Wise Policy Distribution → e.g., 52% male, 48% female
👉 KPIs are highlighted in card visuals, with trend arrows (green ▲ for improvements, red ▼ for declines) for quick interpretation.

📌 Dashboard Features
• Car Use Analysis: Private vs Commercial vs Commute usage impact on claims.
• Car Make & Year: Brand-level claim amounts and risk trends by vehicle age.
• Coverage Zone Insights: Regional breakdown of policies and claims.
• Demographic Profiling: Age groups, gender split, income brackets, and education level.
• Household Risk Factors: Impact of kids driving and parent status on claims.
• Matrix Analysis: Combined education & marital status insights for targeted segmentation.
• Interactive Navigation: Drill-downs, slicers, and tooltips for detailed exploration.

🧮 Tools & Skills Used
•	Microsoft Power BI – Dashboard development
•	Power Query (M) – Data cleaning & transformation
•	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculated KPIs & measures

🧠 Insights
• Private vehicles hold the majority of policies and claims, but commercial vehicles show higher average claim amounts.
• Mid-aged cars (2005–2015) generate more claims compared to very new or very old vehicles.
• Married graduates show a significant concentration of policyholders and claims—valuable for segmentation.
• Urban coverage zones experience higher claim frequency, while rural areas show fewer but costlier claims.
• Households with kids driving display elevated claim risk, indicating need for adjusted premiums.
